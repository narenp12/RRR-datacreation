GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the\nnumber of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a\nmore complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in\ndetail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau\nsearch. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems,\nthere is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of\nsatisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make\ndetailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the\naverage gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score\nand average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by\nshowing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis.\nThis work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to\nimprove understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.",

         "As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning\nprocedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,\nthe analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that\nlearning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be\nrestricted to purely declarative logic languages.",

         "To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information,\nthis paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers\nwith two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is\ngoing to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user\ninterface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice\nsoftware- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and\nsemantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned\ninformation to generate completion strings and construct a user interface.\nDescription of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this\non paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information\non a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking\nsoftwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the\ninterface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and\nconstructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of\nthe note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting\narchive.
